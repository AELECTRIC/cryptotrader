/**
* Bot name: Sell OCO
* Short Description: 
*       One Cancels the Other - 
*       Set 2 values, one high and one low to sell coins depending on how a market trades 
* Author: Bradley Boldt 
*Last Update: January 6, 2018 
*Fork from other bot, code under construction still 
*
* What it does in detail:
    - You have to have available Crypto (BTC/ETH/LTC) [LTC comming soon]
    - The bot will not sell until it hits one of the two target prices
 
*
* Parameters:
* -p <product string>                       The product string in the format "<CRYPTO>-<PAYMENT>". eg: BTC-EUR ETH-USD ETH-EUR, etc..
* -bw <buy worth in USD/EUR>                This amount will be bought in the crypto you specified. eg "-p BTC-USD -w 100" will buy you 100$ worth of Bitcoin
* -g <gain in percent needed for selling>   This is the percentage increase needed for the bot to sell its coins
* -nib                                      No initial buy. Means that the script won't buy the amount you specified when it's run. You can use this to manage coins you already have
* -fip <crypto price in USD/EUR>            Force initial Price. Only in combination with -nib! Uses a crypto price you specify for the first buy. Can be used to restore older sessions
* -sim                                      Simulate only
*
